Crop Disease in Uganda

In this project we'll be working with a dataset of crop disease images from Uganda. We'll build and train a convolutional neural network to classify images into five categories. In the project We'll learn how to improve the performance of a computer vision model by using pre-trained models and by optimizing training with techniques like Callbacks.

Objectives are: 

Explore a crop image dataset.
Build and training a convolutional neural network to classify images into five classes.
Improve the model by using Transfer Learning and adapting a pre-trained image classification model.
Indentify model overfitting.
Evaluate model performance using k-fold cross-validation.
Utilize Callbacks like Learning Rate Scheduling, Checkpointing, and Early Stopping to optimize training.
